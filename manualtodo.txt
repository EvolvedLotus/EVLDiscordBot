    - Try running a simple command like /help to test

=====================================
SECTION 3: RAILWAY.APP SETUP (Discord Bot Hosting)
=====================================

Railway.app provides TRUE 24/7 hosting with $5 FREE credit per month.
This is where your Discord bot will run continuously.

[ ] Step 3.1: Create Railway Account
    - Go to: https://railway.app
    - Click "Login with GitHub"
    - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
    - Complete account setup

[ ] Step 3.2: Create Your Own Repository
    - Create a NEW GitHub repository for your Discord bot (do NOT fork existing repos)
    - Repository name: your-bot-name (e.g., my-discord-bot)
    - Make it public or private (your choice)
    - Upload ALL the bot files to this new repository
    - Push to GitHub: git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git push origin main

[ ] Step 3.4: Create Railway Project
    - Click "New Project" in Railway
    - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
    - Authorize Railway to access your repositories
    - Select your NEW repository (the one you just created)
    - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project

[ ] Step 3.5: Configure Build Settings
    Railway auto-detects Python. Verify these settings:
    - Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Start Command: python bot.py
    (Railway will detect these automatically from your code)

[ ] Step 3.6: Add Environment Variables
    In Railway Dashboard, go to Variables tab and add:

    DISCORD_TOKEN=[paste from Section 2.2]
    DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=[paste from Section 2.3]
    SUPABASE_URL=[paste from Section 1.2]
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[paste from Section 1.2]
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[paste from Section 1.2]
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=[Generate with command from Section 4.6]
    ADMIN_USERNAME=[Your admin username]
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=[Your admin password - will be hashed]
    ENVIRONMENT=production

[ ] Step 3.7: Deploy Bot
    - Railway automatically deploys after you add environment variables
    - Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment
    - Check "Deployments" tab for build logs
    - Look for "Deployment successful" message

[ ] Step 3.8: Verify Bot is Online
    - Go to your Discord server
    - Bot should now show as "Online" (green status)
    - Try running: /help
    - Bot should respond immediately

[ ] Step 3.9: Monitor Resource Usage
    - Railway gives $5 credit per month (renews monthly)
    - Check usage in Railway Dashboard > Metrics
    - A small Discord bot typically uses $2-3/month
    - Set up billing alerts if needed

[ ] Step 3.10: Copy Railway URLs
    RAILWAY_PROJECT_URL=https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
    RAILWAY_BOT_URL=[Your bot's deployment URL from Railway]

[ ] Step 3.11: Enable Automatic Restarts
    - Railway automatically restarts your bot if it crashes
    - This is enabled by default - no configuration needed
    - You can view restart history in the Deployments tab

    Mac/Linux:
    openssl rand -hex 32

    OR Python:
