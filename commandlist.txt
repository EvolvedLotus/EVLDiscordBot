========================
TOTAL SLASH COMMANDS: 76
========================

NOTES:
- All commands are slash commands (/) unless noted as "Legacy"
- Admin commands require Administrator permission
- Some commands have additional permission requirements
- Task and shop commands integrate with the web CMS
- Currency system is per-server (guild-specific)

DUPLICATE RESOLUTION:
- Removed /view_tasks from currency.py (kept in tasks.py)
- Removed /chat from general.py (kept AI chat in ai_cog.py)
- Renamed /clear_chat to /clear_channel in general.py (to distinguish from AI's /clear_chat)
